## Purpose
This script analyzes the log files in the C:\ProgramData\Veeam\Backup\Malware_Detection_Logs folder, extracts warning messages based on a defined pattern, and generates a report. The report can be displayed in the console or saved as an HTML file. It supports filtering messages by a specified number of past days.

Version 1.1 now analyses the log files in the Antivirus folder for scan session in C:\ProgramData\Veeam\Backup\FLRSessions\Windows\<hostname>\, and extracts the found threats.

The output includes the log entry's date and time, the log file's source, and the extracted warning message.
This script is ideal for quickly identifying and reporting relevant log messages from the scanned folders.
